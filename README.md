# VideoFreedomMod #
This was the plugin that powered VideoFreedom for most of 2015. It was a modified version of version 4.2 of the TotalFreedomMod, which was backported from Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.7.4 for some reason. The code quality of my changes to the original plugin were pretty awful, and a lot of that is because I was an 11 year old who didn't know jack shit about the TFM codebase or Java as a whole. Hell, I didn't even know what version control was.

Because I have no interest in using this code for anything in the future (primarily because it is a truly awful modification of the original plugin), I'm now making the code public for anyone to look through. However, I will not be making any changes to this at all.

## Original Contents ##
TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official TotalFreedom Minecraft Server](http://totalfreedom.me/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (DarthSalamon) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
